# MyZx

Let's setup a 48K ZX Spectrum dev environment in GitHub Workspaces - with Dezog ðŸ§®

## Why bother?

Let's make this

- Easy to win

## Open the Dev Environment in GitHub Workspace - right now

### Setup SjASMPlus to run in the workspace

Open the bash terminal and run these step by step:

```bash
unzip tools/sjasmplus.1.18.3.zip -d tools

cd tools/sjasmplus-1.18.3
make clean
make
sudo make install
```

Delete the `tools/sjasmplus-1.18.3` afterwards

TODO:

- Setup so this happens automatically on opening the workspace with a bash script

## Rando Notes

- `F5` works to run the debug
- FIX-ME: Tests require 'Ctrl-Shift-B` to build the "build unit_tests" before the tests are ready; this sucks because I shouldnt need to even know this.

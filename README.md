# MyZx

Let's setup a 48K ZX Spectrum dev environment in GitHub Workspaces - with Dezog ðŸ§®

## Why bother?

Let's make this

- Easy to win

## Open the Dev Environment in GitHub Workspace - right now

### Setup SjASMPlus to run in the workspace

TODO:

- Document the manual process, FFS.
- Setup so this happens automatically on opening the workspace with a bash script

## Rando Notes

- `F5` works to run the debug
- FIX-ME: Tests require 'Ctrl-Shift-B` to build the "build unit_tests" before the tests are ready; this sucks because I shouldnt need to even know this.
